# Purpose 
In this project I created a Note Taker app. This app was created for anyone who wants to take notes wherever they maybe. It perfect for students or any individual who wants to take some notes and save for later use, it's also mobile friendly. 

IT's great for someone who like to make recipes for later use in the kitchen having the notes right in front of you on Ipad or Android tablet when cooking.


# Functionality 

The user can make new note edit new notes and save notes and also delete previous notes. This was done using express in the backend. The Get Method read from the json files each saved note is clicked on and when the user clicks the save button Post Method writes 

the note to the JSON file giving each note a unique id using UUID/v4. When the user click delete button the Delete Method deletes a note if each note has an id from the JSON file.  



# Built With 

This project aside from using i also used Html, CSS and CSS framework Bootstrap and Javascript. I used Node.js and express on the backend  using GET POST DELETE methods to update the app.
